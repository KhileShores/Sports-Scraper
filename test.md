I'm 15 years old and the Tates have helped in life so much. I used to be extremely bullied and was considered 'the joke of the school' just a year ago. Ever since I learned about Andrew and Tristan Tate I adopted a 'military style routine' where I wake up at the same time and sleep time, go on 6 am runs, and live an extremely disciplined life with no social media. And over the past year I have completely grown as a person to where now when I go to school people genuinly look up to me and respect me. Almost everyone wants to engage in a conversation with me now, whether its for complients or just to get to know me better. I have risen up the social hierachy because of my status and the energy I give off. I cannot express enough how much Andrew Tate has improved my life. I cannot thank him enough.
